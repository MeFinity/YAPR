I want this server to look more official

so,im gonna suggest some stuff

# Part 1: Welcome

1.Firstly,change `#welcome` to `#info` or `#rules`

2.Secondly,make a new `#welcome` channel and make it a join log

Howto: Server settings > Overview > System Messages Channel

3.i suggest you fix first time joins

- Problem: i suspect that the invite link is made while you're in the `#recipes` channel,this is why for people first time joins they see the `#recipes` channel,so they wont meet the `#info (or #rules)` channel until they explore abit,this is not really professional and makes it more likely that people would break rules cause they havent seen it

- Fix: make an invite that is made in the `#info` channel so people would meet **the law** first time joins,then change the link on websites that you promote the server to

- Howto: right click `#info` channel > click invite button
